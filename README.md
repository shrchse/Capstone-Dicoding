# Capstone-Dicoding [Countrybute]
Countrybute is a Web-based App that can be use for people or community to announce their event, campaign, etc to gather more people into community

In this project, I use Firebase as back-end services to implement authentication and database. As for CSS framework, I use Boostrap 5.2 to maintain responsivness
